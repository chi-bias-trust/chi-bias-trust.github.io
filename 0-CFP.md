# Call for Papers

Calibrating trust in AI systems remains a persistent challenge: users often struggle to decide when to accept or question AI recommendations. Cognitive biases — systematic deviations from rational judgement — play a significant role in these difficulties. As AI grows more sophisticated with generative models and LLMs, these biases may manifest in novel ways, influencing trust in ways we do not yet fully understand. This workshop explores how cognitive biases shape trust calibration in AI, and how they might be mitigated, or even leveraged, to design more trustworthy and human–aligned systems. We invite researchers and practitioners from HCI, human–centred AI, cognitive psychology, and related fields to join our 90–minute, in-person workshop at CHI 2026 in Barcelona, Spain. The session will feature interactive activities where we collaboratively identify and map biases in human–AI interaction, brainstorm design strategies and solutions, and reflect on challenges and tensions. Together, we will identify pressing research directions and create a shared agenda for advancing this space. To participate, please submit either a *motivation essay* (1–2 pages) or an *abridged short paper* (2–4 pages) surrounding one or more workshop themes: understanding and mapping biases in human–AI interaction, designing strategies to mitigate adverse effects of biases or leverage useful heuristics, and methodologies or case studies for capturing bias-driven trust dynamics. Page limits exclude references. Submissions should follow [the CHI Extended Abstract template](https://chi2026.acm.org/chi-publication-formats/), be submitted via [Google Forms](https://forms.gle/8gCa1TAffyNEyA2T9) and will be reviewed based on quality and relevance. Accepted papers will be published on our website with participants' consent. We expect 25–35 participants and welcome diverse perspectives, including those underrepresented in the HCI community.
